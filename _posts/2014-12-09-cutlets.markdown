If you get good quality, thin-sliced meat cutlets, you can get creative with the type of meat you use. This recipe works best however with white meat like chicken, turkey, or pork.

#####You need:

* Three medium bowls
* Fork
* Plate
* Frying Pan

#####Ingredients:

* 1/4-inch thin-sliced turkey, chicken, veal, or pork cutlets
* cooking oil
* flour
* 1 egg
* package bread crumbs or panko (japanese-style bread crumbs)

>If you have any extra seasoning on hand, you can jazz up this dish by mixing the seasoning in with the flour

#####Procedure:

1. Put the flour in one bowl, the bread crumbs in another bowl, and crack the egg and stir it until it is mixed into the third bowl

2. Assemble the cutlets assembly-line style. Dip the cutlet first in flour, then the egg mixture, then the bread crumbs and set aside

3. When the cutlets are ready to cook, heat 3 tablespoons of oil over a medium-hot stove

4. Brown the cutlets, a few at a time, in the oil. Add more oil if necessary, heating it before you add more cutlets.

5. To keep cutlets warm and crispy before serving, put them on an ovenproof plate and heat in a stove, or place in a warm toaster oven.
