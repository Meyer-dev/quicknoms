It's a New England tradition to go apple picking, but you wind up with a ton of apples to process and that's no fun after the first few batches! Here's my secret to creating quick applesauce, no peeling required!

#####You need:

* Cooking Pot
* Apple Corer (optional)
* Knife

#####Ingredients:

* 10 apples
* apple cider (optional) or water
* 3 T cinnamon
* 1/2 white sugar or to taste

#####Procedure:

1. Wash and core apples. Cut in half and throw into the cooking pot. No need to peel!

2. Add 1/2 cup water or cider to avoid scorching.
3. Cook over med-high heat until the apples are soft. Depending on the variety, they may start to disintegrate.

4. Add cinnamon and sugar and stir to combine all.

5. Remove from heat and let the sauce cool down. The peels are now easy to remove, just fish them out of the bowl and discard.
6. Stir up the sauce and serve warm or cold, or freeze for later.
