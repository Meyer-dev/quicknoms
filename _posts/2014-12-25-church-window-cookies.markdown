* 1 tsp. vanilla flavoring
* 1 stick butter (1/2 cup)
* either 1/2 bag sweetened flaked coconut, graham crackers, or nilla wafers, crushed

1. In the microwave, melt the butter and chocolate chips together in a bowl, being careful not to overheat

2. Mix the butter and chocolate well, beating with a spoon until it is well mixed. 

3. Add the vanilla and mix well

4. Pour the marshmallows into a new bowl and pour the chocolate mix over it. Fold together

5. Spread a sheet of plastic wrap on the counter and sprinkle 1/4 of the coconut or other coating over it.

6. Spoon 1/2 of the marshmallow mixture onto the plastic wrap, on top of the coconut, forming a log shape.
