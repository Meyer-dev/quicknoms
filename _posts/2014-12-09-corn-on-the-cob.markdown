Corn on the cob is easy to make, especially if you have a big pot for cooking. Look for sweet corn in season in the grocery store. You can tell if corn is good quality by looking at the tip of the ear - the kernels should come all the way to the top with no gaps and be light yellow and juicy, not shrunken.

#####You need:

* Stock pot
* Knife
* Wooden utensils to manage hot corn

#####Ingredients:

* Ears of sweet corn
* Butter
* Salt and pepper

#####Procedure:

1. Strip off all the leaves and corn silk and wash the ears of corn

2. Trim the top and bottom to make the ends even

3. Boil water in the stock pot

4. When it is boiling, drop in the ears of corn

5. Cook for about 4 minutes and remove from pot

6. To serve, guests can salt/pepper/butter their corn to taste. It's easiest to eat if you have corn holders but not necessary.
