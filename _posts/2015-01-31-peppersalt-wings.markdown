Just in time for game day, or any day, delicious pepper salt wings. This recipe is inspired by some great wings my sister-in-law cooked for us.

#####You need:

* Knife
* Cutting board
* Pan
* Foil
* Grinder or mortar and pestle

#####Ingredients:

* 6 Chicken wings
* 1 T Pepper corns
* 1 T Sea salt or Kosher salt

#####Procedure:

1. Wash the wings and cut them at the joints. Discard the tips. Make sure no feathers remain 

2. In a pan, roast the peppercorns and salt over a hot stove, stirring or shaking to make sure the peppercorns cook evenly. After about 5 minutes, when the mixture is fragrant, remove from heat.

3. Grind up the pepper and salt together in a grinder, blender, or mortar and pestle.

4. Line the roasting pan with foil. Place the wings inside and coat them with the seasoning. Turn over and coat the other side.

5. Close the foil and bake at 350 degrees for about an hour

6. Now you're ready for the game!
