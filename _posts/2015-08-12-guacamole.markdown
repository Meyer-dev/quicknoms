Every cook should be able to whip up a good guacamole. The secret is getting avocadoes that are ripe, or ripening them at home until they are a bit soft to the touch (not squishy). You can ripen them in a brown paper bag to speed up the process.

A tip for cutting avocadoes: wash the unpeeled avocado and run a knife around the perimeter, circling the nut. Twist to open into two halves. Discard the nut and use a spoon to scoop out the ripe meat. Often it comes out in one piece.
