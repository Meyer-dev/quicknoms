Spend a little extra on good-quality sirloin beef strips, you'll be glad you did

#####You need:

* Wooden spoon
* Frying Pan

#####Ingredients:

* Thinly-sliced sirloin beef strips
* Any kind of barbecue sauce. It's really your preference what kind! 
* cooked rice (you can find microwavable rice if you don't want to or can't cook your own)

#####Procedure:

1. Start browning the beef strips in the frying pan

3. Pour the barbecue sauce over (don't use too much, just enough to drench the beef) and continue to cook until the beef is cooked. 

4. Remove from pan and serve over hot rice with a green vegetable side dish
