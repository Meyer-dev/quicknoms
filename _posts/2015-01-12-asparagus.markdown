This recipe is inspired by Mark Bittman and is quick, easy, and fresh.


#####You need:

* Skillet
* Knife
* Cutting board

#####Ingredients:

* Asparagus (1 bunch feeds 2-4 people, depending on how much they like their veggies)
* Butter (to taste)
* Lemon or lime juice (to taste)
* Salt (to taste)

#####Procedure:

1. Wash the asparagus spears, snap off the woody ends, and dry them thoroughly with paper towels or a cloth.

2. Heat a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high to high heat. (My stove goes up to 9. I do this on 7.)

3. When the pan is hot, add the asparagus spears to the dry pan. Cook, rolling them frequently, for 5-7 minutes, until the spears turn bright green and flexible, and are darkly browned or lightly charred. 

4. Move the spears to a bowl or serving dish, toss with butter and lemon or lime juice, then add salt to taste.

#####Tips:

* The spears are meant to be slightly al dente. If you prefer your asparagus cooked until tender, cook for a longer time on slightly lower heat.

* You can substitute olive oil and garlic for butter and lemon for a different flavor profile. 

* Lemon or lime zest is a tasty addition.

* If you don't want to waste the woody ends of the asparagus, you can peel the outer layers with a vegetable peeler instead. Or save the ends and make soup with them later.

* Top the asparagus with a fried or poached egg and add a piece of good bread, and it makes an easy brunch or light dinner.
