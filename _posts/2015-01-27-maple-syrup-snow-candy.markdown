If it's snowing outside, here's a fun, easy, traditional indoor cooking recipe for the whole family

#####You need:

* Mixing bowl
* Spoon
* Pan
* Small bowl of cold water

#####Ingredients:

* Fresh snow
* 1 cup maple syrup (only use the real thing)

#####Procedure:

1. Get a bowl of clean snow ready

2. Boil the maple syrup in a pan, stirring constantly so it won't burn

3. Periodically drop a tiny bit of the hot syrup into the bowl. It will form a soft jelly, then a soft ball, then become a hard ball when it's been boiled enough

4. When the candy is able to form a hard ball in the cold water, drizzle the hot syrup over the snow. Let it cool and dig in!
