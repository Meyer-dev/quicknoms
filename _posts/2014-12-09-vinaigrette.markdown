If you eat salad in a French home, you will probably encounter this simple, homemade way of making salad dressing.

#####You need:

* Mixing bowl
* Spoon

#####Ingredients:

* Red-wine vinegar
* Salad oil (like Sunflower oil)
* Salt and Pepper
* Good quality mustard (Grey Poupon is always good)

#####Procedure:

1. Put about a tablespoonful of mustard in the bottom of the bowl

2. Add two spoonfuls of red-wine vinegar and two spoonfuls of salad oil together in the bottom of the mixing bowl.

3. Mix everything together well. Oil and vinegar don't like to mix so you need to mix quickly. 

4. Sprinkle with salt and pepper

5. You can put lettuce on top of this mix and fold in the dressing to make a salad immediately, or save it for later (you'll want to mix again before serving)
