Banana splits can be made with as few as three or as many as ten+ ingredients. Here's a simple way to make them

#####You need:

* Knife
* Metal spoon

#####Ingredients:

* Bananas
* Vanilla ice cream
* Whipped cream
* Chocolate syrup
* Maraschino cherries

#####Procedure:

1. On a plate or in a bowl, place a peeled banana that is split lengthwise down the middle

2. Top it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream

3. Douse it with chocolate syrup

4. Add a dollop of whipped cream. You can whip your own but it's easier to use the pre-made cans

5. Top it with a maraschino cherry

Of course, you can add all kinds of different ingredients like different flavors of ice cream, chopped nuts, various fruit, syrups, etc. But this recipe is the most basic. Save maraschino cherry syrup to as sauce over ice cream.
