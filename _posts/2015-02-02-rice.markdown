Preparing rice the Asian way, without the use of pre-packaged mixes, is easy if you have a rice cooker. But if you don't, here's how to do it on a stove.

#####You need:

* Non-stick pot with lid
* Spoon

#####Ingredients:

* Rice
* Water

#####Procedure:

1. Put 1/2 cup of dry short-grained rice per person served into a pot

2. Swish the rice in water a few times and drain to rinse it

3. Add water to cover the rice plus about 1/2 inch extra over the rice

4. Boil the rice over medium-high heat, stirring until the water is absorbed

5. Cover with lid, turn down the heat to simmer, and wait about 10 minutes

6. Rice is ready to serve when it is soft.
