Even if you don't like kale, this superfood is worth a try using this dressing. Let the kale marinate in the dressing to soften it and infuse the flavor of the dressing. For a lot of kale, double the ingredients. If you like Sweet Greens salads, this will remind you of that.

#####You need:

* Cutting board
* Knife
* Salad bowl or container
* Sealable Jar
* Spoon

#####Ingredients:

Dressing

* 1 spoonful Mustard (Grey Poupon is best)
* 1 spoonful honey
* 1 spoonful chopped garlic
* 1 spoonful lemon juice
* 1/3 cup olive oil
* Salt and pepper to taste

Salad

* Chopped kale

#####Procedure:

Wash kale, remove stems, and chop fine. Place kale in bowl and set aside.

Place dressing ingredients into a sealable glass jar and shake vigorously to mix well. 

Pour dressing over kale and mix well.

Let this salad sit for a while so the kale will marinate and soften. You just created a superfood feast!
