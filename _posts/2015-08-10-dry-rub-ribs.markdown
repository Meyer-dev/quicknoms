There are many ways to cook baby back ribs. I found that using a crock pot makes everything fall apart, and constant basting with BBQ sauce is a hassle. This is by far the easiest way!

#####You need:

* Foil
* Paper towel
* Pan for oven

#####Ingredients:

* Baby back ribs with no seasoning
* Dry rub (any type will do, look in the spice aisle)
* BBQ sauce (your preference. Maull's sauce from St. Louis is good, so is Sweet Baby Ray's)

#####Procedure:

1. Over the sink, open the pack of baby back ribs and wash quickly. Pat dry.
2. Place foil in a pan and lay the ribs on top. Rub the dry rub all over the ribs, both sides. 
3. Loosely pinch the foil over the ribs, leaving a little breathing room
4. Cook in a low oven (325 degrees) for about 2 hours.
5. When the ribs are almost done, tender and ready to fall off the bone, open the foil, pour some BBQ sauce over them and cook another 10 minutes.
6. Remove from oven and let them rest about 10 minutes.
7. Devour! Rice and some salad are good accompaniments. In the unlikely event there are leftovers, you can make great rib sandwiches the next day by removing the meat from the bone and putting it on small buns.
